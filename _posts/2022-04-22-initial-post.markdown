Hi there, my name is sighmoe and this is the initial post for my personal blog! This blog will serve as a safe space for me to share my ramblings and thoughts about computing and software. I want to use this space to practice writing out thoughts about my personal projects and share them with the world! I'm generally interested in systems programming with a particular emphasis on operating systems, databases, and distributed systems.
